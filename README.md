# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based application to visualize and understand popular pathfinding algorithms and a Q-learning AI agent in a grid environment. Built with Streamlit and Python, this app allows users to choose grid size, obstacles, and starting and ending points, making it an interactive tool to learn about pathfinding.

## Features
- **Algorithms Supported**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path, A* Search with Manhattan distance heuristic, and Q-Learning AI.
- **Customizable Grid**: Choose grid size, starting and ending nodes, and obstacle placement.
- **Animated Visualization**: Watch as each algorithm explores nodes and finds the shortest path to the goal.
- **AI Training**: The Q-learning agent is trained over episodes to improve its pathfinding strategy iteratively, displaying intermediate and final paths.
- **Free Hosting**: Deployed via Streamlit and GitHub Pages.
